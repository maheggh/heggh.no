        </ul>
        <p class="gap">
          This game is developed for the age group between 6 and 13 years old, and I believe this is
          the age group the game is most suitable for, mostly because if we go any lower than this
          it might be difficult to make something that might need to be taped, glued or nailed together.
          If you go any higher than this then this game might not be challenging enough.

          <li>Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable</li>

        <p class="gap">This game aims towards the requirements set by UN, by having many people
          come together to play something together, making the human settlement more inclusive,
          and because you make something useful out of trash, you are also making the cities more
          sustainable.</p>
          <p>
          UNs goal number 11 focuses on reducing waste, "as cities grow, municipal solid waste problems mount.
        99% of the world's urban population breathe polluted air according to new world health organisation air quality guidelines"</p>

      <div class="fonts">
        <h2 class="gap">The font selection</h2>
        <p>For this project I wanted a font with a big font family, that works well when being
          scaled up or down, I also wanted a font without serif.
          I tested out different fonts like roboto, lato, verdana, before landing on a beautiful font
          called "be-vietnam" which I have seen being used by Kevin Powell.

          this font is warm and inviting, easy to reed, and looks somewhat professional.</p>
        <h2 class="gap">The visual hierarchy</h2>
        <ul>
          <li class="gap">Size - Users notice larger elements more easily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I wanted the index page to have a big logo that immidiently catches the eye, and tells
          the user what this page is all about, with the title "The bird game"</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="gap">Color - Bright colors typically attract more attention than muted ones.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I wanted the main navigation to be bright and yellow, so that its immidiently obvious how you
          can get around on the page, its the same color as the main logo, which is of equal importance</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="gap">Contrast - Dramatically contrasted colors are more eye-catching.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The main menu is easily visible because of its strong contrasts, text on dark backgrounds are white or
          yellow,
          while text on bright backgrounds are black or dark blue, to create as much contrasts as possible.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="gap"> Alignment - Out-of-alignment elements stand out over aligned ones.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I used this concept for the headlines, which I placed outside the containers, so that its obvious what
          the page is about.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="gap"> Repetition - Repeating styles can suggest content is related.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I reused some of the same images, and I made the whole page in the same graphical style.</p>
      </div>
      <aside class="aside2">
        <h2 class="gap">The page layout</h2>
        <p>In this project I used a combination of grid and flex for the page layouts, I wanted to have multiple columns
          on wide screens so that
          the content of the page fills the entire screen, making use of the whole screen, therefore I used flex on the
          pages with lots of information.
          for mobile I wanted 1 column, because if there are multiple columns the text gets too small to read.
          I decided to create a hamburger menu for all screens below 980px, which is most mobile screens. The reason I
          did this was because the text on a normal navigation is hard to click on a phone screen when the text is so
          small.
          For the footer I used grid start and grid end properties so that for example the social media buttons will
          always be in the bottom right regardless of size, leaving a more consistant design.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gap">sustainability</h2>
        <p>For sustainability I used white background, and very few colors, so it costs uses less ink to print out. I
          mainly used SVG files, so they can be scaled to the right size regardless of displayed width, so I don't
          need to have huge png or jpg files. The images that are not svgs I made as small as possible to save space.
          And I deleted all excess images.
          I made reusable code as much as possible by nesting multiple classes together and give them common attributes.
          I also deleted un-used attributes regularily to make the code as small as possible.</p>
      </aside>
      <div class="colorscheme">
        <h2 class="gap">The color scheme</h2>
        <p>The color scheme for this page was chosen for strong visibility,
          clear contrasts, and child-friendly colors. I mostly used the same color scheme for the images on the webpage,
          and gave the body a white background
          limiting the amount of colors needed to print out the page.
